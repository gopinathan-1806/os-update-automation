# System Health Check and OS Update Automation Script

## Overview
This script automates the process of checking the health of services on a list of remote hosts and performing OS updates only if the services are healthy. The script performs the following actions:

## 1. Pod Health Check:

A. It retrieves the pod health status for each service (e.g., POD01, sc, proxy, as, etc.) from a health-check script (health_check.sh) executed remotely on each host.

B. The script checks the health status of the pods and prints it in a formatted output.

C. If any service is not healthy, the script retries the check every 60 seconds, up to a maximum of two attempts. If the health status is still not 'Good', it stops the execution and asks for manual intervention.

## 2. OS Update:

A. Once the pod health is confirmed as "Good," the script proceeds with an OS update on the remote host using apt update && apt upgrade.

B. After the update, the script re-checks the pod health to ensure everything remains stable.

## 3. Infra part
I created three VMs for this automation, one VM as master VM / host VM and rest of the two VMs as worker machines.
